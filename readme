to build distilled:

1. prepare your build environment. read the instructions here on the android
   website:

     http://source.android.com/download/using-repo

   stop at the "Initializing a Repo client" step.

2. pull down the distilled source files from github:

     mkdir ~/src/distilled/
     cd ~/src/distilled
     repo init -u git://github.com/avatar5d/android_vendor_avatar.git -b eclair
     repo sync

3. compile:

     cd ~/src/distilled
     vendor/avatar/make.sh --src=~/src/distilled --dst=/home/avatar

   when you are prompted to select the build type, choose:

     14. avatar_passion-userdebug

   this will compile the platform, kernel, boot.img, system.img, and create
   a signed update.zip in the directory specified by "dst." If "dst" is not
   specified, only the platform and kernel will be compiled.

   note: make.sh cleans and rebuilds the kernel by default. if you've
   already built the kernel and don't want to recompile it again, use the
   --no-kernel option:

     vendor/avatar/make.sh --src=~/src/distilled --dst=/home/avatar --no-kernel
